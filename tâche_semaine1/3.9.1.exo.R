?coord_map
#coord_map projects a portion of the earth, 
#which is approximately spherical, 
#onto a flat 2D plane using any projection defined by the mapproj package. 
#Map projections do not, in general, preserve straight lines, so this requires considerable computation. 
#coord_quickmap is a quick approximation that does preserve straight lines. 
#It works best for smaller areas closer to the equator.
